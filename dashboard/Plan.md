# Dashboard Plan

This has ideas and plans for unbloxyes!(p.s. unbloxyes stands for Unblocked proxy, and games unbl for [unbl]ocked oxy for pr[oxy] and es for gam[es]
Like Car axle, we want it to be a file, with links to proxys, and games, along with bypassing methods, also it should have a good desgin

## Desgin ideas

Idea for sidebar:

and topbar:

I think we sould have a side bar, but more rounded

Sources being documentaton site for nebula, [Home Page](https://docs.nebulaproxy.io/en) for top bar, and [Docs page](https://docs.nebulaproxy.io/en/docs/NebulaWeb/marketplace)

also should we consider this [AI](https://github.com/AI-QL/chat-ui/blob/main/index.html)? It is dowloadable as a plain html file and works well.

## Section ideas:
- Proxy - top nav bar
- Games - side nav bar with search: Likely all new gitlab selinite games
- Settings - with side nav bar: themes, proxy types, tab name/favicon, eject as about:blank or blob, dev mode activation(for devs like us), shorcut settings, panic key etc.
- Credits - because
- Eject page into about:blank or blob - for people to use their own unblocked websites,
- Feedback - for suggestions so we know what to improve on, and what to add - use google forms for this

Future section ideas:
- AI - found a downloadle plain html file for an AI that works, just wondering if people would use this on things that could get them in serious trouble, (think we could just put a disclaimer like - we are not responsible for how you use this and the consequnces of such - or something like that, but still should be considered )
- Plugins? - I mean like if we get a lot of good sugestions that increase the file size by a lot then we should add this to keep the file small for when people download it.
