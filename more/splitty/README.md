# Splitty

Splitty is a tiny speedrun-oriented timer made in Javascript and HTML5.

## Use it online

Since this timer is written without any server-side language, you can use it directly from your browser from the Github Pages server at this address : 

[http://ylorant.github.io/splitty](http://ylorant.github.io/splitty)

## What it can do

* Time speedruns, plays, pastas, whatever
* Have split-times
* Save your timers and splits
* Save your personal best on them
* Save your personal bests on each split ("gold" times)
* Delay timer start (but it can't delay splits)
* Import/Export timers in its own format.

##Â What it can't do (yet)

* Import/Export to another timer's format.
* Delay splitting on every split.
* Split graph
* Split icons
